                    <p>During the first iteration, we focused on brainstorming and creating initial design concepts for the BabyThrift app. We explored different layouts, color schemes, and user interface elements to achieve a visually appealing and user-friendly design.</p>
                    <p>We conducted user feedback sessions to gather input and refined our designs based on user preferences. The result of this iteration was a set of wireframes and mockups that formed the foundation for the app's visual identity.</p>
